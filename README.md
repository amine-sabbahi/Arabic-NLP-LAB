# Arabic NLP Lab Analysis
## Project Overview
This project encompasses a series of natural language processing (NLP) tasks performed on Arabic text scraped from Al Jazeera articles about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Utilizing Python and several NLP libraries, including BeautifulSoup for web scraping, MongoDB for data storage, and Stanza for advanced linguistic processing, this lab aims to demonstrate the application of text preprocessing, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) within the context of Arabic language processing.

## Objectives

<ul>
  <li>Scrape Arabic news articles from Al Jazeera.</li>
  <li>Store and manage scraped data in MongoDB.</li>
  <li>Apply text preprocessing techniques tailored for Arabic.</li>
  <li>Establishing an NLP pipeline.</li>
  <li>Applying Stemming and Lemmatization</li>
  <li>Perform POS tagging and NER using the Stanza library.</li>
  <li>Analyze the challenges and insights derived from NLP tasks on Arabic text.</li>
</ul>

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
