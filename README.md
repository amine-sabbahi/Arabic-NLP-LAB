# Arabic NLP Lab Analysis
## Project Overview
This project encompasses a series of natural language processing (NLP) tasks performed on Arabic text scraped from Al Jazeera articles about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Utilizing Python and several NLP libraries, including BeautifulSoup for web scraping, MongoDB for data storage, and Stanza for advanced linguistic processing, this lab aims to demonstrate the application of text preprocessing, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) within the context of Arabic language processing.

## Objectives
-Scrape Arabic news articles from Al Jazeera
-Store and manage scraped data in MongoDB
-Apply text preprocessing techniques tailored for Arabic
-Perform POS tagging and NER using the Stanza library
-Analyze the challenges and insights derived from NLP tasks on Arabic text

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
MongoDB
Jupyter Lab

### Libraries Installation

pip install beautifulsoup4 pymongo nltk stanza requests
Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your system. Java might be required for some specific NLP libraries or tools not covered in this lab but considered for extended analysis.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the Python scripts according to the lab instructions.
## Key Learnings
Web Scraping and Data Storage: Mastery in ethical web scraping practices and structured data storage in MongoDB.
Text Preprocessing: Insights into text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, normalization, stemming, and lemmatization specifically for Arabic text.
POS Tagging and NER: Understanding the complexities of applying POS tagging and NER to Arabic, leveraging the Stanza library.
Normalization Challenges: The implications of normalization on advanced NLP tasks, highlighting the trade-offs between preprocessing goals and the accuracy of linguistic annotations.
Language-Specific Tools: The significance of selecting appropriate NLP tools and libraries for processing Arabic, emphasizing the benefits of language-specific resources like Farasa.
## Conclusion
This lab provided a practical exploration into NLP applications for Arabic text, shedding light on both the technical and linguistic considerations critical to processing a highly inflected language like Arabic. Through this project, we navigated the end-to-end process of extracting, processing, and analyzing Arabic text data, offering valuable insights into the unique challenges and methodologies in Arabic NLP.
